## Setup

Ensure you have the following files in your project directory:

- `chess.py` - Contains the `Chess` class and game logic.
- `piece.py` - Contains the piece classes like `Pawn`, `Rook`, `Knight`, `Bishop`, `Queen`, and `King`.
- `main.py` - Entry point to run the game.

## How to Play

1. **Run the game:**
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. **Game Start:**
    The game initializes with the standard chess setup and displays the board. Each cell shows a piece symbol or a dot (`.`) for empty spaces.

3. **Move a piece:**
    Enter moves in standard chess notation, for example:
    ```sh
    > Enter move (e.g., a2 a4): a2 a4
    ```

4. **Board Representation:**
    The board is represented as follows:
    ```
       +------------------------+
     8 | r  n  b  q  k  b  n  r |
     7 | p  p  p  p  p  p  p  p |
     6 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . |
     5 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . |
     4 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . |
     3 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . |
     2 | P  P  P  P  P  P  P  P |
     1 | R  N  B  Q  K  B  N  R |
       +------------------------+
         a  b  c  d  e  f  g  h
    ```

5. **Invalid Moves:**
    The game will notify you if a move is invalid. Ensure moves are legal according to chess rules.

6. **Game Continuation:**
    Continue entering moves until checkmate, stalemate, or resignation.
